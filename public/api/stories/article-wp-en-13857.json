Usually, the Speaker is appointed without election with the consent of both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro-tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab declared the election results after the Opposition, which had put forward Congress MP K Suresh as its candidate, chose not to push for a vote on the motion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the announcement, Prime Minister Modi and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju approached Birla's seat in the front row of the treasury benches to escort him to the Speaker's chair. Accompanying them was Rahul Gandhi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It is a matter of honour that you have been elected to this chair for the second time,\" PM Modi said, congratulating  Birla. \"I congratulate you on behalf of the entire House and look forward to your guidance for the next five years. Your sweet smile keeps the entire House happy.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the entire opposition and the INDIA alliance,\" said Rahul Gandhi. \"You are the final arbiter of people's voice. The government may have political power, but Opposition also represents the voice of the people. Opposition would like to assist you in your work, I am confident you will allow us to speak in House.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birla has returned to the Lok Sabha for the third time from Kota in Rajasthan. Birla won the Kota parliamentary seat by a margin of more than 41,139 votes, thus becoming the first presiding officer in 20 years to be re-elected to the Lower House.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/nda-nominee-om-birla-elected-lok-sabha-speaker%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
