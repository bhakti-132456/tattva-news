These initiatives, including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and subsidies for food and fertilizers, account for a substantial US$ 54.34 billion (Rs. 4.55 trillion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report, authored by agriculture economists Mr. Ashok Gulati and Ms. Purvi Thangraj, highlights that food and fertilizer subsidies comprised over 50% of the Union Budget for the rural and agrarian sectors in FY25. With the central government allocating US$ 74.05 billion (Rs. 6.2 trillion) to the agriculture sector, which constitutes 13% of the overall budget of US$ 575.66 billion (Rs. 48.2 trillion), it is noted that agriculture contributes 18% to GDP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these significant allocations, the welfare initiatives have not effectively addressed the issue of low rural incomes, with the average income for a rural family being less than US$ 238.86 (Rs. 20,000) per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low incomes in agricultural households impact demand for non-agricultural goods and limit manufacturing sector growth. He emphasizes that investments in agricultural research and development, irrigation, and skill development yield better returns than traditional welfare schemes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The household consumption survey by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s (MOSPI’s) National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) revealed that rural individuals spent US$ 45.06 (Rs. 3,773) monthly on average in 2022-23, compared to US$ 77.14 (Rs. 6,459) for urban individuals. Rural demand is marginally improving, dependent on erratic monsoons, higher inflation, and unseasonal rains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He suggests rationalizing expenditure on subsidies and investing in developmental expenditures, which could also lead to adopting climate-smart practices and improved crop yields. In Budget 2024, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman proposed measures to boost the agriculture sector, including new high-yield variety seeds, natural farming provisions, promoting self-sufficiency for oil seeds and pulses, and digital public infrastructure for farmers.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/special-stories/73-of-indias-agriculture-budget-is-allocated-for-subsidies%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
