A five-judge Constitution bench had on February 15 scrapped the electoral bonds scheme of anonymous political funding introduced by the BJP government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the top court's judgement, the State Bank of India, the authorised financial institution under the scheme, had shared the data with the EC, which later made it public. The electoral bonds scheme, which was notified by the government on January 2, 2018, was pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties as part of its efforts to bring in transparency in political funding.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/sc-declines-probe-by-sit-into-alleged-quid-pro-quo-in-electoral-bonds%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
