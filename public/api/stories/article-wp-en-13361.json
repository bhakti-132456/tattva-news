The brutal and illegal invasion by Russia can never be justified, and we condemn this aggression, the violence and the killings in the strongest possible terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In this context, the efforts of the Ukrainian unions to provide vital humanitarian support have been amazing. They stand as pillars of resilience and hope, organising crucial assistance. We stand by their side in their fight for freedom, justice and democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a show of solidarity for workers risking their lives daily, the delegation visited a power plant severely damaged by a Russian missile strike where they met workers and their union representatives. Luc Triangle commented: “What happened here is a clear example of targeting essential infrastructure and making daily life more difficult. Working people in Ukraine and their unions are making extraordinary efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These frequent attacks on workplaces increase the need for psycho-social aid to workers and people.

These changes include undermining collective bargaining, fewer protections in the hiring and firing process, and disruption to social dialogue processes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The delegation met with senior politicians at the parliament to discuss these issues , including Oleksandr Kornienko (First Deputy Chairman of the Verkhova Rada (Parliament)) and Yulia Tymoshenko (Former Prime Minister, current leader of the opposition).</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/international/solitary-visit-to-ukraine-reaffirming-global-trade-union-movements-support%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
