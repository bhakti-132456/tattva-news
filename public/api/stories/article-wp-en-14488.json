The bench said it would be a travesty of justice to relegate him to the trial court for seeking bail in these cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top court said it is high time that the trial courts and high courts recognise that the principle of bail is a rule and jail is an exception. It directed that Sisodia be released on bail on a personal bond of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of the like amount.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/manish-sisodia-walks-out-of-jail-after-17-months%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
