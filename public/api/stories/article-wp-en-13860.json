Earlier in the, the CBI had officially arrested him in connection with the money laundering probe into now-scrapped excise policy. The central investigative agency asked for 5 days of custody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kejriwal has been in jail since April 1 in connection with the excise policy-linked money laundering case being probed by the ED. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the CBI interrogated Kejriwal in Tihar Jail concerning the liquor policy case, recording his statement. Subsequently, the agency sought and obtained a production warrant for Kejriwal from a special court. The CBI is set to present him before a trial court at 10 am on Wednesday, possibly before the Supreme Court hearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kejriwal was granted bail by a Delhi court on June 20 after his arrest by the ED on March 21. However, the ED challenged this decision in the Delhi High Court, which subsequently stayed the bail on June 21 and reserved its order for June 25. Kejriwal's legal team then approached the Supreme Court, which advised waiting for the High Court's order rather than issuing an immediate decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court pronounced that the trial court did not outline the necessary conditions for Kejriwal's release under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), under which he is charged, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing legal battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 was withdrawn by the Kejriwal government in July 2022 after Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena recommended a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in its formulation and implementation.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/economy/cbi-gets-three-day-custody-of-kejriwal%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
