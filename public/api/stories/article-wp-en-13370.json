Sisodia, accused of creating a liquor policy that benefited private businesses at the cost of the public exchequer, has been in jail since his arrest by the CBI on February 26, 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was subsequently arrested by the ED on March 9, 2023, in connection with related money laundering charges.  Sisodia allegedly manipulated the excise policy to favour private entities, causing significant losses to the government treasury. He is also accused of using funds from the liquor scam for election campaigning in Goa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the excise minister, he reportedly made decisions that violated policy norms and is alleged to have destroyed evidence, including changing 14 phones and 43 SIM cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the High Court's rejection of his bail plea, Sisodia plans to approach the Supreme Court for relief. Sisodia's initial arrest was by the CBI on February 26, 2023, followed by the ED on March 9, 2023, for money laundering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has remained in Tihar Jail since his arrests, with multiple extensions of his judicial custody by the Rouse Avenue Court. Sisodia sought bail to participate in the ongoing Lok Sabha election campaign. However, with voting in Delhi scheduled for May 25, his plea was denied, preventing him from campaigning in person.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/economy/delhi-high-court-rejects-bail-for-manish-sisodia%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
