The FIR was lodged in this connection following a complaint by Ravi Tiwari at Ayodhya's Kotwali city police station on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FIR was lodged under BNS sections 140 (3) (kidnapping), 115 (2) (voluntary causing hurt), 191 (3) (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 351 (3) (criminal intimidation by threatening to cause death), police said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident allegedly occurred near the State Bank of India's main branch intersection in the Faizabad City on Saturday afternoon after a dispute over commission in a land purchase case, police said. The FIR alleged that Ajit Prasad and five-six others assaulted, threatened and kidnapped Tiwari.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In relation to the case, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya took to social media, stating, \"Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad, whom Akhilesh Yadav is currently supporting, has a son, Ajit Prasad, who 'kidnapped' Ravi Tiwari and 'beat him up.' Since the Samajwadi Party won a few seats, incidents of violence and hooliganism have not ceased.\" Malviya further said, \"There’s a saying in Uttar Pradesh—wherever the SP flag is raised, goons are present.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is pertinent to mention that the Samajwadi Party is likely to field Ajit Prasad, the son of Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad, as its candidate for the Milkipur constituency in the forthcoming Assembly bypolls, said sources. Milkipur fell vacant after Awadhesh Prasad was elected to Lok Sabha from Faizabad (Ayodhya) seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the by-election dates have not yet been announced, there is speculation that the Samajwadi Party might field Ajit Prasad, son of Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad, from Milkipur and Lalji Verma's daughter from Katehari. Ticket claimants, including Devmani Kanaujia, have also approached the SP office. .</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/fir-lodged-against-ayodhya-mp-awadhesh-prasads-son-for-assaulting-man%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
