The ex-President and his wife endorsed Harris, 59, over a one-minute long private phone call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\" Obama told Harris over the phone call. \"I cannot have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,\" said Michelle Obama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris's surprise bid against Republican rival Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race amid slumping poll numbers. Obama, the first US Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obama initially withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent. Obama reportedly did not want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee. However, the latest show of support could activate and sustain energy and fundraising for Harris' campaign and he might get on the campaign trail once she becomes the official nominee of the Democratic Party.<strong></strong></p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/international/barack-obama-endorses-kamala-harris-as-presidential-candidate%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
