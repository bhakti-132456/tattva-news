They had this arrangement in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as well,\" he added. He reiterated his appeasement charge at Congress and alleged that the grand old party wants to extend the \"Karnataka model wherein Muslims were inducted in the 27 per cent quota for OBCs\", in the entire country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The Congress-led alliance has vowed to murder social justice. Congress wants to change the Constitution and rob Dalits, OBCs of quota benefits for religion-based reservation,\" he said and accused the Congress of stooping low for appeasement and vote bank politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prime Minister slammed Congress over the issue of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and said that it declined the invitation for its consecration. Targeting Rahul Gandhi  over wealth distribution, Modi said, \"The Congress shehzade wants to search your wealth and distribute it to those who the party had said to have the first right on the country's resources\".</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The Congress wanted to impose inheritance tax and rob people of their inheritance. Such people shouldn't get even a slight chance of coming to power,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> He said that after the end of the second phase of voting, the NDA is leading 2-0 in the elections. \"Kolhapur is known as a football hub. With the second phase of polling completed, I will say the NDA is leading 2-0 while the Congress alliance engaged in anti-India policies and politics of hate has scored two self-goals,\" he added.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/i-n-d-i-a-bloc-plans-to-have-five-pms-in-5-years-if-elected-pm-modi%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
