After the '15-second remark' against the Owaisi brothers by the incumbent Amravati MP, followed by the counterattack by the AIMIM chief, Rana held another blistering attack against the Owaisi brothers on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Rana reiterated her veiled threat against All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leaders  Asaduddin Owaisi and Akbaruddin Owaisi. She said that a senior Owaisi member (referring to Asaduddin) said, \"I have suppressed the junior, my junior is like a field gun. I want to tell you that we keep such field guns outside our homes for decoration. The senior says, our junior is ferocious, such ferocious ones are kept inside our homes. Remember, I am also the daughter of a former soldier; I also want to see how long the hen and its chick can survive.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a challenging tone, she further added that she is coming to Hyderabad soon and would like to see who stops her. It is pertinent to note that the recent attack comes in the aftermath of the controversy around the '15-second remark' erupted between the Owaisi brothers and BJP leader Navneet Rana.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/bjp-mp-rana-dare-owaisi-i-am-coming-to-hyderabad-lets-see-who-stops-me%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
