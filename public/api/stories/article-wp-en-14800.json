BJP president JP Nadda, Home Minister Amit Shah and other top leaders attended the party event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"If an organisation does not give value to internal democracy, then the situation arises which is seen in several parties in the country,\" PM Modi said while addressing the party workers. The Prime Minister remembered several workers of the party and said, \"Several generations have invested their lives into this party, then today the party has made its place in the hearts of the people.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shah, while addressing the event, said the BJP is not only the world's largest political party but also the most democratic party. No other party conducts its membership drive with such transparency and honesty as the BJP, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh praised PM Modi, saying the PM has made sure that even if we dream big, our promises to people must always remain in alignment with what we are capable of delivering. \"We must be able to translate our promises into actions. This is why the BJP stands out as the most credible political party in the world. We don't do politics for the sake of forming govt, but to form an empowered society,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing the party event, Nadda said, \"I welcome and thank all of our karyakartas (party workers) for coming to this event! Modi ji, being the Pradhan Sevak of the country, maintains a busy schedule to monitor the nuances of governance. He is an inspiration and a role model for all of us. PM Modi has always prioritised Sangathan. Whenever Sangathan needed him, PM Modi made sure to take time out of his busy schedule and be there for the Sangathan.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"When Amit Bhai Shah was the national president of the party, at that time he had given priority to the membership campaign. He had said that we will change the path of the organisation, we will change the methods of the organisation, so that we can include more and more people in the party who want to walk with the lotus symbol,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>'\"Join the BJP's membership drive starting from September 2.
