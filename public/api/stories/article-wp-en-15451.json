This is revealed by the report that Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released yesterday, entitled “Journalism in the #MeToo era.”<br><br>Out of the 113 journalists surveyed in nearly the same number of countries, over 80% noted a significant increase in the number of stories covering women's rights, gender issues, and gender-based violence since 2017, when the #MeToo slogan was born in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The slogan has since been translated into many languages and taken different names, at least 40 of which have been catalogued by RSF, such as #EuTambém in Brazil, #EnaZeda in Tunisia, #Cuéntalo in Spain, and #WoYeShi in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The #MeToo movement has also spurred the creation of new media outlets, changes to newsroom policies and the development of new journalist networks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while investigations into women's rights and gender-based violence appear to be taken more seriously, RSF is alarmed by the continued violent repression of the journalists who cover these issues, which includes cyber-harassment, physical attacks, and, in some countries, the risk of detention and even death. Over 25% of the survey’s respondents considered it dangerous to work on these subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> 27% of those questioned for the report, and nearly 60% said they know at least one case of a journalist who has been subjected to cyber-harassment for covering these subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hostility is still so strong in countries with authoritarian regimes, such as Russia, that self-exile is sometimes the only option. Since the Taliban retook control in Afghanistan, women journalists have been expelled from the media or forced to flee the country.<br><br>RSF therefore calls for the adoption and reinforcement of measures to protect and guarantee independent information on gender-based violence and women's rights, freeing journalists of any fear of repercussions. RSF’s 16 recommendations include: criminalising certain forms of cyber harassment, holding social media platforms accountable for preventing and combating these attacks, and recruiting editorial managers responsible for gender issues.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/special-stories/journalism-in-the-metoo-era-more-exposed-still-persecuted%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
