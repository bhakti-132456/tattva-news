This came after reports emerged of a 22-year-old man from Haryana, who was killed after being sent to the frontlines against Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press statement, the Russian embassy wrote that it has received numerous requests from the media to comment on the issue of Indians serving in the Russian Army after \"unfortunate instances\" of casualties in Ukraine. \"The Embassy expresses deep condolences to the Government of India and the families of the deceased,\" it said in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The agencies concerned in both countries work in close coordination for early identification and discharge of Indian nationals who voluntarily contracted for military service in Russia. All contractual obligations and due compensation payments will be fulfilled in full measure,\" it added. The embassy also said that it has stopped the admission of citizens from several foreign countries, including India, in its Army.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The Embassy outlines that the Russian Government has at no point of time been engaged in any public or obscure campaigns, more so in fraudulent schemes to recruit Indian nationals for military service in Russia,\" it added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This statement came after Russia agreed to India's demand to ensure early release and return of Indian nationals working in the Russian military after Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, the Indian embassy in Moscow confirmed the death of Ravi Moun, who hailed from Matour village in Haryana's Kaithal district, his brother Ajay Moun said. Ravi Moun went to Russia on January 13 after being \"hired\" for a transportation job but was inducted into the military, his brother claimed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 11, India said two Indian nationals, who were recruited by the Russian Army, had recently been killed in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which took the number of such deaths to four. Following the deaths of two Indians, the Ministry of External Affairs demanded a \"verified stop\" to further recruitment of Indian nationals by the Russian Army.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/russia-expresses-condolences-for-indian-nationals-killed-in-ukraine-war%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
