While Starc castled Sharma in the first over, Arora dismissed the deadly Head for a third duck in four innings before KKR seized complete momentum. Andre Russell and the spinners neutralised the middle-order, with the West Indies quick scalping three wickets for 19 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRH were reduced to 113 in 18.3 overs – the lowest score in an IPL  final – before the Knights romped home in a breezy chase. Led by Venkatesh Iyer’s quickfire fifty in 24 balls, KKR trumped Sunrisers for the third time this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venkatesh also became KKR’s most prolific run-scorer in IPL Playoffs, crossing 200 runs in only five innings. Though opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz was controversially dismissed leg-before in the absence of the DRS system, Venkatesh went on to hit the winning runs as KKR secured the title with an unbeaten streak extending to six completed matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kolkata Knight Riders Playing XI: </strong>Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Venkatesh Iyer, Shreyas Iyer (c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Mitchell Starc, Vaibhav Arora, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad Playing XI: </strong>Travis Head (substituted by Abdul Samad), Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen  (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat,  T Natarajan. </p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/kolkata-knight-riders-won-their-third-ipl-title%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
