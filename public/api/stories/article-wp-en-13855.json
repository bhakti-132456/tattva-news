He took the oath as an MP on Tuesday while holding a copy of the Constitution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Congress, as the largest opposition party, has attained the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) position after a decade. In the previous two elections, it did not meet the 10 per cent membership threshold in the Lok Sabha necessary to secure the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing the media after the meeting of floor leaders of the I.N.D.I.A bloc, Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said, \"Congress MP Rahul Gandhi has been appointed as the LoP in the Lok Sabha. Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi wrote to Pro-tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab, informing him of the decision to appoint Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha,\" senior party leader KC Venugopal told reporters after the meeting.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>he 18th Lok Sabha will have a Leader of the Opposition (LoP) for the first time in ten years. This time, the leader of Congress, which is the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha with 99 MPs, has been recognized as the Leader of the Opposition (LoP).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous two Lok Sabhas, the Congress, as the largest opposition party, could not secure the post because it did not meet the required number, which is one-tenth of the strength of the House. In the 16th Lok Sabha, the Congress had 44 MPs, while in the 17th Lok Sabha, it had 55.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post of LoP was not recognised till 1969 when Ram Subhag Singh became the first recognised LoP of the Lok Sabha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post received statutory recognition through the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 which defines the term 'Leader of the Opposition' as that member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha who, for the time being, is the leader of that House of the party in opposition to the government having the greatest numerical strength and recognised, as such, by the chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the speaker of the Lok Sabha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi took oath as Lok Sabha MP and displayed the Constitution in his hand, showing it to both the treasury and Opposition benches. He ended his oath-taking with slogans of 'Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhan'.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/rahul-gandhi-to-be-leader-of-opposition-%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
