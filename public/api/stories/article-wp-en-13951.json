Such attempts should not be ignored by calling them 'balak buddhi'. There is a deeper conspiracy,\" Modi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on Hinduism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the \"conspiracy to falsely accuse Hindus\" is a serious matter. He asserted that the people of the country will never forgive what happened yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was said that Hindus are violent. Are these your values? Is this your character? Is this your hatred for Hindus of this country? This country will not forget this for centuries. These are people who tried to coin the phrase Hindu terror. Their allies compare Hinduism with dengue, malaria, etc,. and these people clap. Their entire ecosystem wants to look down upon, abuse and insult Hinduism. After the scenes yesterday, Hindus have to think – is this insult a coincidence or part of a design,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gandhi had said on Monday caused an uproar in the House when, while attacking the BJP, he said “those who call themselves Hindus talk violence… hatred… untruth 24 hours”. Modi said that even as the country chose the path of development, the Congress is bent on spreading chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"They speak against the North in the South, and against the West in the North. They have tried to divide based on religion and even gave election tickets to those who had advocated division of the country. They are spreading rumours to divide people on caste grounds” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They are also attempting to spread economic chaos. The way they are taking economic decisions in their states is taking the country towards financial crisis. They tried to bring the Indian democratic system under a question mark. They spread chaos on CAA. The whole ecosystem promoted this to fulfill their political ends. They tried to provoke riots in the country,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modi, concluding his over two-hour-long speech, said \"truth cannot be suppressed, lies have no roots\". \"May Baalak Buddhi get Sadbuddhi (may childish mindset gain wisdom). The truth can never be defeated by shouting. I enjoyed today – I have lived the power of truth today,\" Modi said.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/pm-modis-balak-budhhi-jibe-at-rahul-gandhi%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
