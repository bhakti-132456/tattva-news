A letter from Hon’ble Chairperson@sharmarekha has been sent to Commissioner of Police Delhi to take CDRs of relevant individuals, including the CM, to ascertain on whose direction Mr. Bibhav Kumar was summoned.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NCW also sought a report on the threats being issued to Swati Maliwal and action taken in this regard. Expressing concern, the NCW further said, \"Additionally, the Commission mandates strict action against individuals issuing rape and death threats to Ms. Maliwal. The accused person(s) should be charged under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. A comprehensive report is expected in 3 days.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Swati Maliwal claimed that she has been receiving rape and death threats and accused YouTuber Dhruv Rathee of posting a one-sided video against her. Swati also said that AAP orchestrated a campaign of character assassination, victim shaming, and fanning of emotions against her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delhi CM's aide Bibhav Kumar, who has been arrested, is accused of assaulting the AAP Rajya Sabha member at the chief minister's residence on May 13. He was sent to four days' judicial custody on May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a bench of Delhi High Court headed by Acting Chief Justice Manmohan ordered the waiver of the fine after the petitioner apologised. A fine of Rs 1 lakh was imposed by the Delhi High Court on May 8, while dismissing a petition seeking to stop media from reporting against Arvind Kejriwal and also refrain political rivals from making statements against the Delhi CM.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/ncw-asks-delhi-police-to-check-call-records-of-cm-kejriwal%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
