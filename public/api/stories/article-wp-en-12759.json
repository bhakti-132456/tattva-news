The main opposition party TDP has complained to the Election Commission of India (ECI) about  alleged tapping of phone of its general secretary Nara Lokesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phoe tapping came to their notice after Lokesh received alert mails from Apple on his iPone, stating that they found attempts to tap his phone from some unkown sources, using some unidentified technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The party alleged that some police officers at the instance of the state government were tapping the phone. The complaint was made to the ECI by its former Rajya Sabha member K Ravindra Kumar on Friday in a letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEC was told that Lokesh received alerts from i-phone, informing that his phone was tapped using Pegasus software by unknown agencies. He had also received the alerts last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TDP leader recalled that time and again they represented that DGP Rajendranath Reddy and intelligence chief PSR Anjaneyulu had become “lackeys” of YSRCP and were resorting to “unethical and unlawful acts to jeopardise” the prospects of NDA alliance partners in the ensuing election to Andhra Pradesh Assembly and Lok Sabha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He reiterated that Rajendranath Reddy has been holding the position of DGP as in-charge for last two years which is violative of orders of the Supreme Court. The TDP leader also alleged that Anjaneyulu is a “henchman” of the state government and there are several allegations against the biased functioning of this officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TDP leader urged the ECI to initiate action against these officers, appoint neutral and reputed officers in their positions and ensure free and fair elections.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/telegu-state/tdp-complains-to-eci-about-nara-lokesh-phone-tapping-%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
