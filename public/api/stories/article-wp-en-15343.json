He described it as a \"big game changer\" to boost consumer confidence in EV adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, HMIL plans to raise US$ 7.82 billion (Rs. 27,780 crore) through India's largest-ever initial public offer (IPO), with bidding set for October 15 to 17. The company’s pre-IPO red herring prospectus indicates that royalty payments to the parent company, Hyundai Motor Corporation, account for 3.5% of its sales revenue, a rate that will remain stable unless OECD guidelines on transfer pricing change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Unsoo Kim emphasized that the Indian EV market is still in its \"early stage of electrification\" and is expected to grow steadily, aided by government support and OEM focus. Mr. Tarun Garg highlighted Creta's significant impact on the SUV market since its launch in 2015, noting that its share has risen from 13% to around 60%. He also stated that the slowdown in the Indian EV market should not be compared to global trends, as India still has considerable room for growth in electrification.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/economy/indian-ev-market-may-grow-strongly-steadily-till-2030%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
