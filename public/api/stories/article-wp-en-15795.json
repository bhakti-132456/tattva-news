He attributed the growth to both technical expertise and strong political leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stated that the capacity added over the past 10 years equals what was achieved over 60 years. He projected that India's atomic power capacity would triple by 2031-32, reaching 22,480 MW. He also highlighted a revised electricity distribution formula, ensuring fairness with 50% allocated to the home state, 35% to neighbouring states, and 15% to the national grid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further emphasised India's leadership in peaceful applications of atomic energy, particularly in agriculture and healthcare. Atomic energy has facilitated the development of 70 mutagenic crop varieties and enabled cancer treatments using isotopes. He noted that India holds 21% of the world’s reserves on thorium, with ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on uranium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He mentioned the indigenous Bhavini project, which evaluates thorium usage and aims to lessen dependence on imported materials. Despite some delays in Tamil Nadu, including the Tirunelveli project, he praised the progress of the Kudankulam and Kalpakkam nuclear plants, which have gained momentum since 2014. </p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/india-to-triple-atomic-power-capacity-by-2031%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
