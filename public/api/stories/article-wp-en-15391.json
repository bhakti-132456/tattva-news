Kohli scored a brave fifty in the second innings to complete 9,000 runs in Test cricket and became the only fourth Indian to achieve this historic feat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being bowled out on a duck in the first match, the former captain displayed some glimpses of returning to his best with a much-needed fifty in the second innings. Kohli achieved the 9000 Test runs milestone after reaching the 53-run mark at M Chinnaswamy Stadium and joined legendary Sachin Tendulkar,  Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar in the elite list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gavaskar achieved this milestone in 192 innings in 1985 while Tendulkar took 179 innings to score 9000 Test runs in 2004. Dravid was the last Indian cricketer to achieve this feat in 2006 and also the fastest in terms of the fewest innings of 176. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Kohli reached his first 8000 runs in March 2022 but took more than two and half years to reach the 9000-run mark. Kohli took 70 balls to register his 60th fifty-plus score in red-ball cricket and first since December 2023.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/virat-kohli-joins-legendary-indian-trio-in-test-cricket-record%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
