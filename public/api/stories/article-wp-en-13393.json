Deve Gowda has issued a stern warning to his grandson and JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna, asking him to surrender before the police and face probe in the sexual abuse allegations against him. “This is not an appeal that I am making, it is a warning that I am issuing,” the party patriarch said in a statement which he shared on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prajwal, who is seeking re-election from Hassan Lok Sabha constituency, has been on the run ever since a huge cache of explicit videos become public, showing women being sexually assaulted allegedly by him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prajwal reportedly flew to Germany in the last week of April. An arrest warrant has also been issued against him besides a blue corner notice by the Interpol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deve Gowda's letter reflects his stance: \"At this juncture, I can only do one thing. I can issue a stern warning to Prajwal and ask him to return from wherever he is and surrender before the Police. He should subject himself to the legal process”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further wanred that “This is not an appeal that I am making, it is a warning that I am issuing. If he does not heed this warning he will have to face my anger and the anger of all his family, If he has any respect left for me he has to return immediately.\"  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 92-year-old veteran reiterated that his grandson should be given the harshest punishment under the law if found guilty. He also asserted that there will be no interference from him or his family members in the investigation against Prajwal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is no emotion in this regard in my mind whatsoever, there is only the cause of justice for those who have suffered as a result of his alleged actions and misdeeds,” said Gowda.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/deva-gowada-warns-prajwal-revanna-to-surrender%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
