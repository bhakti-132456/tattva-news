Can the Hemant Soren government stop this? In the high court, his government said they don't want to stop this. Champai Soren opposed this and left the party (JMM),\" said Union Home Minister Amit Shah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"You form a BJP government here, we will drive out the infiltrators from Jharkhand,\" Shah added. Shah, while releasing the saffron party's manifesto 'Sankalp Patra' for the upcoming assembly elections in Jharkhand, announced that a Displacement Commission would be formed to ensure rehabilitation of people displaced by industries and mines in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Our government will introduce UCC in Jharkhand but tribals will be kept out of its ambit. Hemant Soren and the JMM government are making false propaganda that UCC will impact tribal rights, culture and relevant legislation, which is totally baseless as they will be kept out of its ambit,\" Shah added</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significantly, during the rally, Shah also assured the public that under the BJP government, they would bring out stringent laws for tribal welfare. He stated that a law would be introduced that would not allow tribal land to be transferred to any intruder's name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Infiltrators lure our tribal sisters and daughters in Jharkhand, marry them, and grab their land in return. We promise you that we will bring such a law that tribal land will not be transferred to the name of any intruder, and those who have grabbed it will have to return it,\" Shah added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the Union Home Minister, in another significant announcement aimed at tribal welfare, informed that while the UCC will be implemented in Jharkhand, it will keep tribals out of its ambit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"They (JMM-Congress) are spreading rumours that the implementation of UCC will end the law and culture of the tribals. Today I am saying here that UCC will be implemented in Jharkhand, but it will not be implemented on tribals. The Modi government will protect the culture of tribals and their laws,\" the Union Home Minister remarked. </p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/amit-shah-promises-to-remove-infiltrators-from-jharkhand%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
