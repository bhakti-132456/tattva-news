He emphatically declared that the country is no longer a \"sleeping giant,\" asserting that its ascent is now unstoppable and firmly rooted in the principles of democracy and education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the importance of education, He stated that it should be viewed as a service to society rather than a commercial endeavour, highlighting that \"the quality of education defines democracy.\" This perspective underscores the critical role of empowering citizens through knowledge and skills, which are essential for fostering a vibrant democratic society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to discussing education, Jagdeep Dhankhar addressed significant reforms in governance, noting that middlemen have been permanently removed from the corridors of power, which had previously been plagued by corruption. This transformation is vital for restoring integrity and accountability within the political system, ultimately leading to a more transparent and efficient government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to the International Day of Democracy, he highlighted the role of technology in modern governance, describing artificial intelligence as a transformative tool for enhancing good governance and improving public service delivery. By framing India's current trajectory as one of inevitable progress, he instilled a sense of optimism about the nation's future, reinforcing the idea that collective efforts will drive India toward a more prosperous and equitable society.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/indias-rise-unstoppable-says-vice-president/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
