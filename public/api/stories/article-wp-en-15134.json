Ahead of his planned visit to the temple, the district police earlier in the day issued notice to several leaders and cadre of the party not to defy Section 30 of the Police Act which is in force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His much-hyped Tirumala tour was announced as part of the YSRCP's call for prayers in temples to atone for TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu's 'sin' through his allegations on the quality of Tirupati laddus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Section 30 of the Police Act which regulates public assemblies and processions is in force in the district. We have noticed several postings on social media platforms asking people to gather at certain places in Tirupati. The notices are nothing but cautioning them not to come and defy orders. Jagan Mohan Reddy may also be issued a notice at the airport not to defy prohibitory orders,\" the official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reddy's appeal comes days after Chandrababu Naidu alleged that the previous YSRCP government used substandard ingredients and animal fat for making the laddus at Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati. The allegations sparked a massive controversy across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, YSRCP general secretary Gadikota Srikanth Reddy said several leaders of the party in Rayachoti in Annamayya District were warned by authorities not to venture out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The YSRCP chief's planned visit to the temple to offer prayers on Saturday was to raise political temperatures in Andhra Pradesh as the ruling NDA is sticking to its guns on the demand that the former chief minister should declare his faith before entering the hill shrine.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/telegu-state/jagan-cancels-tirumala-visit-amid-demands-for-his-faith-declaration-%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
