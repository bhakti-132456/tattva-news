He also accused the Congress of looting the poor and not improving their condition for its selfish politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"They (Congress) think that if we all unite, then their agenda to divide the country will fail. Congress only knows how to loot the poor and keep them poor for its selfish politics. It only knows how to divide people. We have to be alert and remain united. Congress is run by a gang of urban Naxals,\" PM Modi alleged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone can see how closely Congress stands with those people who do not harbour good intentions for India, PM Modi said. “Drugs worth thousands of crores of rupees were seized in Delhi recently. A Congress leader is suspected to be the kingpin. Congress wants to contest elections from the money it gets by pushing the youth towards drugs,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian Youth Congress had said on October 3 that Tushar Goel, the suspected kingpin, was expelled from the organisation on October 17, 2022, for anti-party activities, soon after BJP spokesperson and MP Sudhanshu Trivedi charged the opposition party with having links with the drug dealers. Modi alleged that Congress' thinking has been foreign from the very beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prime Minister also accused the Congress of leaving no stone unturned to make the lives of farmers miserable. \"The governments run by the Congress used the money meant for farmers and irrigation schemes for corruption,\" he alleged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PM also asked people to beware of the Congress propaganda of false assurance of farm loan waiver. \"People in Telangana are still waiting for the loan waiver. In Karnataka, the Congress government stopped the irrigation schemes started by the BJP regime,\" he said.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/pm-modi-alleges-congress-being-run-by-urban-naxals%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
