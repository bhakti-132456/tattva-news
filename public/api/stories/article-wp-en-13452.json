RSF has reasonable grounds for thinking that some were deliberately killed and that the others were the victims of deliberate attacks against civilians by the israeli army.<br><br>This complaint is being filed on the ninth anniversary of Resolution 2222 on protecting journalists in wartime, which the United Nations Security Council adopted unanimously on 27 May 2015 and which stresses the importance of prosecuting and punishing war crimes against journalists.<br><br><strong>Impunity endangers journalists not only in Palestine but throughout the world.</strong> Those who kill journalists are attacking the public's right to information, which is even more essential in times of conflict. They must be held accountable, and RSF will continue to work to this end, in solidarity with Gaza’s reporters.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/international/war-crimes-in-gaza-rsf-files-a-new-complaint%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
