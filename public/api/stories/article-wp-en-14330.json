Is this Nyay for the SC/ST communities?” Sitharaman indicated towards Congress' ‘Ab Hoga Nyay’ slogan from the Lok Sabha elections. Congress had used the slogan asserting that it would provide justice to downtrodden communities and enact policies for their upliftment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karnataka government is grappling with the accusations of a Rs 187 crore scam in the Karnataka Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribe Corporation, which includes the illegal transfer of Rs 88 crore. The Finance Minister accused Siddaramaiah of concealing facts and trying to pass the blame on to the central government just because bank officials of a nationalised bank were involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitharam's comment came as a rebuttal of Siddaramaiah's charge that the union finance minister should be held accountable because banks were involved, Speaking on Siddaramaiah's statement, Sitharaman said, “He can say that because he is used to talking like this, That’s so irresponsive. You have your minister resigned. You have your people saying that the money has been siphoned into private accounts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The finance minister asserted that action had already been taken against the conniving bank officials at first and assured that further action would also be taken against them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> \"No protection will be offered to them for sure\", she added. However, she also said, “A minister had to resign under whose oversight? Attempt to deny, attempt to shift blame, or to say that no scandal has taken place. It’s SC/ST money. Whose money was taken away – Valmiki community’s. Is there no sense of outrage?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking charge, FM called out Siddaramaiah on being a finance minister in the state and still being unaware of the illegal transfer of money. She said while the bank is already taking action on officials, how the minister involved in the scam and the chief minister who holds the finance portfolio did not stop the bank from illegally transferring money.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/sitharaman-asks-cm-siddaramaiah-syphoning-sc-st-money-off-is-nyay%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
