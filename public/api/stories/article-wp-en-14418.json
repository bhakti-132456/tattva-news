After the ruling party suffered a setback in the Lok Sabha elections, Saini has announced several sops to reach out to various sections ahead of assembly polls due later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing the party's 'Vijay Shankhnad' rally, Saini said the BJP government in the state is currently procuring 14 crops at MSP. \"I am happy to state that in the last 10 years, the state government purchased 14 crops at MSP. Today, nine more crops are pending. All crops in Haryana will now be bought at MSP by our government. I announce this today,\" said Saini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saini said the state government also waived the outstanding 'abiana' ( canal water for irrigation) charge of Rs 133 crore. It will benefit farmers to the tune of Rs 54 crore per annum, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also announced the payment of pending compensation of Rs 137 crore within a week to farmers who suffered crop damage because of natural calamity in Rohtak, Nuh, Fatehabad and Sirsa before 2023.
