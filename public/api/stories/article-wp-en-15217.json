The SIT will also consist of two state police officers and one member of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying that the allegations had the potential of hurting sentiments of people worldwide, the Supreme Court said the SIT investigation would be monitored by the CBI director. \"In order to assuage the feelings of crores of people, we find that an investigation by an independent SIT consisting of representatives of state police, CBI and FSSAI, shall be done,\" a bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top court, however, clarified that it was passing the order to assuage the feelings of the crores of devotees of the famed Sri Venkateswara Temple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We clarify that our order should not be construed as a reflection on the independence and fairness of the members of the state SIT. We have constituted the committee only to assuage the feelings of crores of people having faith in the deity,\" the Supreme Court said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, however, refrained from making any comment on the merits of the allegations and counter-allegations in the matter, saying it would not permit the court to be used as a \"political battleground\".</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue stems from Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s public statement on the former Y.S. Government led by Jagan Mohan Reddy. The statement triggered a political debate, with the YSR Congress party accusing Naidu of making unsubstantiated allegations for political gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an earlier hearing on September 30, the Supreme Court referred to Naidu's public statement that it came before the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) before filing an official FIR and ordered caution on politically charged cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court on Friday noted that the Solicitor General had recommended that a central government officer can be appointed to supervise the probe.“We clarify that our order should not be construed as a reflection on the independence and fairness on the members of the state SIT. We have constituted the committee only to assuage the feelings of crores of people having faith in the deity,” the court said.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/supreme-court-forms-special-sid-into-tirupati-laddu-row%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
