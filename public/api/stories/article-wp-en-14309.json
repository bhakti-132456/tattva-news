Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced the state government's decision to extend reservations to Agniveers in government services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hours after Yogi Adityanath’s announcement, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav also announced a reservation for Agniveers in state police and other armed forces. In a post on X, MP CM said, \"Today, on the occasion of Kargil Day, our government has decided that as per the wishes of our illustrious Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Agniveer jawans will be given reservation in the recruitment of police and armed forces.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both CM Mohan Yadav and CM Yogi's announcement came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi also lambasted the opposition on Friday in a veiled attack for spreading misconceptions about the Agnipath scheme. Speaking at the Kargil Vijay Diwas function, PM Modi sternly refuted the allegations that the Agnipath scheme is being implemented to save pension money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"When Agniveers return after their service, the Uttar Pradesh government will provide these youth the facility of adjustment in Police Service and PAC on a priority basis,\" the UP CM said. Significantly, the Chief Minister, during his statement to the media, also called out a few political parties for misleading people and demeaning the centre's efforts towards progress, prosperity, and national development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Reforms done from time to time to establish a new paradigm of progress and prosperity are essential for any country and society. Under PM Modi's leadership, several steps have been taken in the past 10 years, and reforms have been made in every sector to give a respectable position to our economy and establish India as the fifth-largest global economy” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asserted that we need to give national security equal importance and armed forces have also advanced with this reform. Today, Indian armed forces are equipped with ultra-modern fighter aircraft. Defence manufacturing corridors are being developed in UP and Tamil Nadu, he added.</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/national/agniveers-to-get-reservation-in-up-and-madhya-pradesh%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
