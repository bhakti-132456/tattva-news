Bengaluru ranks globally owing to its strong tech ecosystem and high projected GDP growth per capita.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delhi, projected to become the world’s most populous city by FY50, is attracting significant migration and economic activity. The Index highlights the growth of Asian cities, particularly in India, driven by urbanisation, economic expansion, and technological innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mumbai, India’s financial hub, underpins global trade and investment goals. Hyderabad and Pune are emerging as key centres for tech, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>India’s growth trajectory is supported by the government’s focus on infrastructure development, a simplified tax regime, and policies aimed at industrial revival. With only 35% of the population living in urban areas, continued migration from rural and smaller towns is expected to drive urban expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian cities are forecasted to witness GDP growth of over 68% by FY33, driven by rising disposable incomes, a growing middle class, and increased consumption. Key sectors such as tech, real estate, and hospitality are booming, with office and warehousing space uptake reaching record levels in top-tier cities in FY23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government’s infrastructure push transforms urban landscapes, including metro expansions and smart city initiatives. At the same time, nearly 96 million sq. ft. of new life sciences real estate is expected by FY30 to support emerging industries. </p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/economy/five-indian-cities-among-the-top-15-fastest-growing-global-urban-centres-by-fy33%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
