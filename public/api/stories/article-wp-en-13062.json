However, the ITUC is cautious about the emphasis on innovative financing, which has shown limited development impact.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this intervention at the FfD Forum, Anne Cecile Coly from UNSAS, Senegal, explained that private financing too often does not deliver the decent work promised, and that it is up to governments to change this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luc Triangle continued: “It is encouraging to see recognition of the need to scale up financing for development, but it’s clearly not enough to meet the urgent need for a deep economic, societal and environmental transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It must translate into concrete, ambitious action at all levels including deeper reform of the international financial architecture, as we set out in this statement, to rescue the SDGs. We must continue this work at the Summit of the Future  in September and the Financing for Development Conference in June 2025.”</p>\n","originalUrl":"https://en.tattvanews.com/international/ituc-calls-for-systemic-shift-at-un-financing-for-development-forum%ef%bf%bc/","hasAudio":false,"hasInfographics":false}
